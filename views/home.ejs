    <h1 class="section-heading">Hi Everybody!</h1>
    <p>My name is Ceren and I am a seniour who likes coding. I
      am currently studying for my university exams and am preparing my Commonapp applications. Other than that,
      people see me play table tennis most of the time and I try to read more. I like maths,
      actually, I loved maths but know I only like it. And believe me, after you deal with
      maths olympiads for a considerable amount of time like me, your love for math hardly increases.

    <p>
      Betamat is an online publication aimed at publishing easy-to-read and fun concepts
      in mathematics. I founded Betamat with 4 of my friends with whom I met in Ali Nesin's
      Matematics Village in 2019. We started off as a small team of writers, then got bigger.
      Now Betamat has more than 50 articles both in English and <a href="https://medium.com/betamat">Turkish</a>

<!-- Math Olympiads History -->
<section class="maths">
  <h3 class="section-heading">My Good Old Friend: Mathematics.</h3>
  <p>
    I have spent 3 years of my high school as an olympiad student studying in maths.
    Hence, I have attended many math competitions and gained some experience about this world.
    I left studying for the olympiads because it consumed almost 90% of my day, which was a big
    commitment and as I climbed up through the grades, it did not seem any more reasonable to me
    to spare that much time instead of studying for APs, SATs, school exams etc. Plus, my mind shift
    about the career I wanna pursue also had a big effect on my decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some of awards I got and exams I participated in as a result of my perseverence in this path.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>EMC Third Prize 2019</li>
    <li>EMC Honourable Mention 2020</li>
    <li>Turkish Math Competition (TMY) 2nd Place</li>
    <li>TÜBİTAK National Maths Olympiads First Level Eliminations</li>
    <li>TÜBİTAK National Maths Olympiads Second Level Eliminations</li>
    <li>EGMO National Girls Team Selection Exam</li>
  </ul>
<h3 class="section-heading">My Maths Project.</h3>
<p>
  Other than olympiads I also made a project about a problem known to be unsolved yet.
  And I am currently trying to get it published on some science magazine. So, wish me luck!
  Hopefully I'll be able to leave a link here for that article in the future.
